			<h1>Work</h1>
			<p>I've spent the last 3 years working for Holiday Extras, in the Short Breaks team. I'm a Front End Developer, that means I get to handle how the websites looks, run and most importantly how they satisfy our customers needs.</p>
			<p> I've enjoyed working closely with brands such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paultonsbreaks.com/">Paultons Breaks</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" href="http://legolandholidays.co.uk/">Legoland Holidays</a>, but I've worked with some smaller brands like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.show-and-stay.co.uk/">Show &amp; Stay</a></p>

			<h2>Paultons Breaks</h2>
			<p>This was the first responsive website that we had produced, so it was brilliant to be on the front line. I relished in getting the chance to spend time talking to our customers, so we could ensure we were solving real problems.</p>

			<h2>Webpagetest Mongo Wrapper</h2>
			<p>I enjoy stretching myself, and I've got a real passion for site speed. So getting the chance to build a wrapper to make use of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">Webpage test</a> API, and storing the results into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, was something I really enjoyed. <br/>The data from this is currently being displayed interally at our work, using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, but the code is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Shortbreaks/webpagetest-mongo-wrapper">Github</a> and it's available on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/webpagetest-mongo-wrapper">NPM</a>.</p>

			<h2>And more...</h2>
			<p>I don't want to list my life story, but I hope this is a glimpse into what I do day to day.<br/> If you want to extend this list, by adding your project onto it, I would love to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:lukefrake@gmail.com">here from you</a></p>
